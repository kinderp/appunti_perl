# By now you have seen at least a dozen built-in functions: print, sort, map, grep, keys, scalar and so on. 
#Built-in functions are one of Perl's greatest strengths. They

#    are numerous
#    are very useful
#    are extensively documented
#    vary greatly in syntax, so check the documentation
#    sometimes accept regular expressions as arguments
#    sometimes accept entire blocks of code as arguments
#    sometimes don't require commas between arguments
#    sometimes will consume an arbitrary number of comma-separated arguments and sometimes will not
#    sometimes will fill in their own arguments if too few are supplied
#    generally don't require brackets around their arguments except in ambiguous circumstances

# The best advice regarding built-in functions is to know that they exist. 
# Skim the documentation for future reference. 
# If you are carrying out a task which feels like it's low-level and common enough that it's been done many times before, the chances are that it has.
